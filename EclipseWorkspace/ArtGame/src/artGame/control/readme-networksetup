Q: WAIT, I JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW TO RUN THE THING. HELP. 
A: Oops, sorry! It's very similar to PacMan.
   So if you want a server, then run Main with:
	-server <some number greater than 0>
   For a client, run it with
   	-connect <whatever IP the server spits out> -port 32768

===================================================================================
1. Structure of the TCP Server-to-Client process
===================================================================================
Hello, gentle reader! I trust you've come here before triyng to look at the rest
of the code. That's probably a good idea.

Anyway, as it currently stands: Main, ServerThread and ClientThread are the
only classes you might be interested in. ServerThread and ClientThread have methods
for reading and writing information directly to their sockets. At the moment,
server and client can read and respond to each other's requests for movement and
to take items. 

The next step is to push all these methods into a separate class, 
BasicPacketParser, and this will have the capacity to both read byte arrays as
instructions the Game can act on (the Action classes) and convert data to 
byte arrays.  

===================================================================================
2. Structure of data transmissions
===================================================================================
Currently, all data is read in sequences, but when the classes are properly
implemented these numbers will correspond to data in a byte array. 
Note that while you can read the data as an integer, we should only need shorts,
and the code is going to change to reflect this. 
(Short: two bytes, making up any number from 0-32767 inclusive.)

Here's what each player's action looks like in numbers:

HEADER, SEND BEFORE ALL DATA:
	[0] = Is this a game world update? (then 1, otherwise 0)
	[1] = ID of the item/player/guard taking an action, or 0 for network updates.
			(The server sends responses with the id of the client it's 
			communicating with, except in the case of network updates.
	[2] = message type, as defined by the enums and static variables in 
			BasicPacketParser. 
	
DATA CONTENTS:
	IF MOVEMENT:								IF RECEIVING ITEM:
	[3] = character's current X					[3] = if item is to be taken from a character, player's ID
	[4] = character's current Y					[4] = item ID
	[5] = character's destination X				
	[6] = character's destination Y			
	
	IF LOSING ITEM:								IF ACCESSING INVENTORY, CLIENT REQUEST
	[3] = ID of item to be removed				[3] inventory of player's inventory to send 
	
												IF READING AN INVENTORY, SERVER RESPONSE
												[3-1023] Item IDs of the inventory's contents.
										
	IF ESCAPING LEVEL:							IF BEING CAUGHT:
	(empty; sent after player has				(empty)
	clicked 'ok, take me out')

	IF USING ITEM ON OBJECT, CLIENT REQUEST:	IF CHANGING OBJECT STATE, SERVER UPDATE:
	[3] id of object							[3] if player, player id, else 0
	[4] id of item								[4] if item, item id, else 0
												[5] int value representing state
DATA TERMINATOR: 										
... followed by the max integer value.
