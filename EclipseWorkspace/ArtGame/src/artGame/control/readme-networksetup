Q: WAIT, I JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW TO RUN THE THING. HELP. 
A: Oops, sorry! It's very similar to PacMan.
   So if you want a server, then run Main with:
	-server <some number greater than 0> and a -loadgame <some game xml file>
   For a client, run it with
   	-connect <whatever IP the server spits out> -port 32768 -loadgame <some xml file>
   	
===================================================================================

TODO LIST:
1. need a way to convert from IDs to objects
2. server needs to give client its id at the start of the interaction
3. which means the server needs a way to get a unique ID from Game

1. Structure of the TCP Server-to-Client process
===================================================================================
Hello, gentle reader! I trust you've come here before trying to look at the rest
of the code. That's probably a good idea.

Anyway, as it currently stands: Main, ServerThread and ClientThread are the
only classes you might be interested in. ServerThread and ClientThread have methods
for reading and writing information directly to their sockets. At the moment,
server and client can read and respond to each other's requests for movement and
to take items. 

The next step is to push all these methods into a separate class, 
BasicPacketParser, and this will have the capacity to both read the stream as
instructions the Game can act on (the Action classes) and write them.

===================================================================================
2. Structure of data transmissions
===================================================================================
Currently, all data is read in sequences, but when the classes are properly
implemented these numbers will correspond to data in a byte array. 
Note that while you can read the data as an integer, we should only need shorts,
and the code is going to change to reflect this. 
(Short: two bytes, making up any number from 0-32767 inclusive.)

Here's what each player's action looks like in numbers:

HEADER, SEND BEFORE ALL DATA:
	[0] = Is this a game world update? (then 1, otherwise 0)
	[1] = ID of the item/player/guard taking an action, or 0 for network updates.
			(The server sends responses with the id of the client it's 
			communicating with, except in the case of network updates.
	[2] = message type, as defined by the enums and static variables in 
			Packet. 
	
DATA CONTENTS:
	IF MOVEMENT:								IF RECEIVING ITEM:
	[3]	= moving entity's id		INT			[3] = ID of entity receiving item	INT
	[4] = character's current X		INT			[4] = item ID						INT
	[5] = character's current Y		INT		
	[6] = current direction			BYTE
	[7] = time of sending			LONG
	
	IF LOSING ITEM:								IF ACCESSING INVENTORY, CLIENT REQUEST
	[3] = ID of entity losing the item			[3] id of inventory owner 
	[4] = ID of item to be removed
												IF READING AN INVENTORY, SERVER RESPONSE
												[3] id of inventory owner
												[4-1023] Item IDs of the inventory's contents.
										
	IF ESCAPING LEVEL:							IF BEING CAUGHT:
	(empty; sent after player has				(empty)
	clicked 'ok, take me out')

	IF USING ITEM ON OBJECT, CLIENT REQUEST:	IF CHANGING OBJECT STATE, SERVER UPDATE:
	[3] id of using player 						[3] if player, player id, else 0
	[4] id of entity							[4] if item, item id, else 0
	[5] id of item								[5] int value representing state
	
	IF INTERACTING IN SOME WAY, CLIENT REQST:
	(empty; sent after player has pressed 'F'
	on some object in the world, to be
	interpreted by server's Game.)
					
DATA TERMINATOR: 										
... followed by the max integer value.
